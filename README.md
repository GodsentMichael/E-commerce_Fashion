# E-commerce_Fashion

This fashion e-commerce website is built using HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript and PHP. With MySQL as the database. 
The website allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout using a simple form. This project was built as part of my way of attempting a real time usable project using PHP in the backend and to also showcase my skills in front-end web development.

## Features
Browse products by category
View product details including name, description, and price
Add products to cart and view cart contents
Remove products from cart
Checkout using a simple form
Login/Getting Started
To get started with the project, assuming you want to contribute in future(which ofcourse you must have asked for permission to contribute), you'll need to have a code editor installed on your computer, in my case I use VS Code or Atom. You'll also need a web browser to view the website.

Then,
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
clone or fork the repo.

Open the project in your code editor.

Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the website.
